                                        Sparse signal recovery is an important topic of signal processing with many potential applications. This talk presents some state-of-the-art optimization models for sparse signal recovery and studies a newly developed quadratically constrained sub-one quasi-norm optimization model for better recovery.

                                        In this lecture, I present the principles of the HAT data ownership model that aims to fundamentally re-balance the power and influence of data usage on the Internet through the use of markets. I describe the set of legal data rights crafted for individuals, and its technical implementation in the form of the HAT Microserver.
                                     
                                        I then discuss the design of the HATDeX platform, it’s governance and its economic and technical implementation to emerge a market for personal data at the “Edge” ie. real time on demand data transaction with Internet applications at the point of data usage.

                                        Finally, I present data from the platform and report the progress of the mission to re-decentralise the Internet.

                                        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not just technology, but the potential of revolutionary and disruptive change. Applications of AI are touching every walk of our lives even though years of research have shown us that the original objective of human like AI is a tougher proposition. Real-life cases of AI range from fraud monitoring, computer games, to driverless cars. AI has ushered in humanity's new age as the Industrial Revolution led to today's modern society. The business potential from emerging AI is unlimited. Global companies and high tech start-ups are revolutionizing the current business models while IT researchers are sharpening their studies coupled with this AI related phenomenon. Drawing from on-going AI business applications and research, this talk will offer managerial and theoretical implications for practice and business.

                                        In bibliometrics, there are two main procedures to explore a research field: performance analysis and science mapping. Performance analysis aims at evaluating groups of scientific actors (countries, universities, departments, researchers) and the impact of their activity on the basis of bibliographic data. Science mapping aims at displaying the structural and dynamic aspects of scientific research, delimiting a research field, and quantifying and visualizing the detected subfields by means of co-word analysis or documents co-citation analysis. In this talk we present two bibliometric tools that we have developed in our research laboratory SECABA: H-Classics to develop performance analysis by based on Highly Cited Papers and SciMAT to develop science mapping guided by performance bibliometric indicators.
