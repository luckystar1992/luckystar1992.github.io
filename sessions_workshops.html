                                    In the context of new business models applied to the present day enterprises and organizations, multi-participant  decision-making activities have gained ever more traction. Over the latest decades, the vast majorities of decisions are made by collaborative groups and collectivities, and even negotiation panels. Consensus building, solution selection, and crowdsourcing-based decisions have been supported by modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) available on the market. The session is meant to include papers that contain recent results obtained by research teams from academia and industry concerning the following topics:

                                    In 1965 Lotfi A. Zadeh published "Fuzzy Sets", his pioneering and controversial paper, that now reaches over 101,000 citations. All Zadeh’s papers were cited over 217,000 times: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S6H-0RAAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Citations</a>
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px;" class="nice-copy-story font-s13 push-10-t ">
                                    Starting from the ideas presented in that paper, Zadeh founded later the Fuzzy Logic theory, that proved to have useful applications, from consumer to industrial intelligent products. We are presenting general aspects of Zadeh’s contributions to the development of Soft Computing(SC) and Artificial Intelligence(AI).
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px;" class="nice-copy-story font-s13 push-5-t ">
                                    In accordance with Zadeh’s definition, Soft Computing (SC) consist of computational techniques in computer science, machine learning and some engineering disciplines, which study, model, and analyze very complex reality: those for which more traditional methods have unusable or inefficiently.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px;" class="nice-copy-story font-s13 push-5-t ">
                                    SC uses soft techniques, contrasting it with classical artificial intelligence, Hard Computing (HC) techniques), and includes: Fuzzy Logic, Neural Computing, Evolutionary Computation, Machine Learning, and Probabilistic Reasoning.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px;" class="nice-copy-story font-s13 push-5-t ">
                                    HC is bound by a Computer Science (CS) concept called NP-Complete, which means that there is a direct connection between the size of a problem and the amount of resources needed to solve that called "grand challenge problem". SC aids to surmount NP-complete problems by using inexact methods to give useful but inexact answers to intractable problems.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px;" class="nice-copy-story font-s13 push-5-t ">
                                    SC became a formal CS area of study in the early 1990’s. Earlier computational approaches could model and precisely analyze only relatively simple systems. More complex systems arising in biology, medicine, the humanities, management sciences, and similar fields often remained intractable to HC. It should be pointed out that simplicity and complexity of systems are relative, and many conventional mathematical models have been both challenging and very productive.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px;" class="nice-copy-story font-s13 push-5-t ">
                                    SC techniques resemble biological processes more closely than traditional techniques, which are largely based on formal logical systems, such as Boolean logic, or rely heavily on computer-aided numerical analysis (as in finite element analysis).
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px;" class="nice-copy-story font-s13 push-5-t ">
                                    SC techniques are intended to complement HC techniques. Unlike HC schemes, which strive for exactness and full truth, soft computing techniques exploit the given tolerance of imprecision, partial truth, and uncertainty for a particular problem. The inductive reasoning plays a larger role in SC than in HC. SC and HC can be used together in certain fusion techniques.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px;" class="nice-copy-story font-s13 push-5-t ">
                                    Soft Computing can deal with ambiguous or noisy data and is tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation. In effect, the role model for SC is the human mind.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px;" class="nice-copy-story font-s13 push-5-t ">
                                        Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelligence based on SC provide the background for the development of smart management systems and decisions in case of ill-posed problems.

                                    The goal of this special session is to bring together researchers interested in applications of soft computing algorithms and procedures in quantitative management and decision making, in order to exchange ideas on problems, solutions, and to work together in a friendly environment.

                                    Decision making in fuzzy environments:
                                </div>
                                <p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px;" class="nice-copy-story font-s13 push-5-t ">
                                In many real-world situations, the problems of decision making are subjected to some constraints, objectives and consequences that are not accurately known. After Bellman and Zadeh introduced for the first time (1970) fuzzy sets within multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM), many researchers have been preoccupied by decision making in fuzzy environments.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px;" class="nice-copy-story font-s13 push-5-t ">
                                The fusion between MCDM and fuzzy set theory has led to a new decision theory, known today as fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (FMCDM), where we have decision-maker models that can deal with incomplete and uncertain knowledge and information.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px;" class="nice-copy-story font-s13 push-5-t ">
                                The most important thing is that, when we want to assess, judge or decide we usually use a natural language in which the words do not have a clear, definite meaning. As a result, we need fuzzy numbers to express linguistic variables, to describe the subjective judgement of a decision maker in a quantitative manner. Fuzzy numbers (FN) most often used are triangular FN, trapezoidal FN and Gaussian FN.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px;" class="nice-copy-story font-s13 push-5-t ">
                                We highlight that the concept of linguistic variable introduced by Lotfi A. Zadeh in 1975 allows computation with words instead of numbers and thus linguistic terms defined by fuzzy sets are intensely used in problems of decision theory for modelling uncertain information.

                                    Big data is active research area in the past few years. There is a clear need to analyze huge amounts of unstructured and structured complex data, historic data as well as data coming from real time feeds (e.g. Business data, meteorological ones from sensors, remote sensing data, etc.). It is beyond the capability of traditional data processing techniques and tools. The challenges include data capture, storage, search, sharing, transfer, analysis, and visualization. In order to meet the requirement of big data analysis, computational science and high performance computing methods and algorithms are in real demand to solve the above challenges, including scalable mathematical methods and algorithms, parallel and distributed computing, cloud computing, etc. This session will focus on the issues of high performance data analysis. Theoretical advances, mathematical methods, algorithms and systems, as well as diverse application areas will be in the focus of the special session.

                                    The challenge of electricity distribution infrastructures’ upgrading to the incorporation of new technologies, where each technological innovation introduced in recent times is directly related to electric power distribution systems, are all invariably affected by the characteristics of such new technologies which require utilities to work diligently and make the necessary investments to ensure that the current networks maintain their electricity supply behavior (safe and constant) in the face of major disruptions and adverse environmental conditions from a variety of sources. Indeed, a fundamental aspect in order to support their constant rate of growth.  At the residential, commercial or industrial level, consumption peaks and other undesirable phenomena in frequency, voltage regulation and harmonic content have increased substantially over the years; an issue which undoubtedly represents a challenge for market players in the electricity distribution market. So for us together with the incorporation of new technologies in distributed generation of energy and electric mobility among others, we must also incorporate, evaluate and implement new technologies that make our distribution networks more efficient and reliable. Thus occupying this innovative drive in storage systems and control systems, it will be possible to determine the best way in which these systems can help to efficiently absorb or reduce the undesired phenomena that we have described above. In addition, as a strategic focus of digitalization of networks and online services to provide more and better service and information to customers we need to look to the future and through these implementation and development initiatives we will be able to also assess the accuracy and responsiveness of the system in different operating scenarios, evaluate reliability and performance capacity compared to today that there are no developments in this field of applications.

                                    Energy storage through Lithium–ion batteries has gained considerable interest as an option to respond to these new challenges and provide flexibility to the system to cope with high levels of renewable energy, driven by ever-increasing use in the electric mobility industry. Energy storage systems provide flexibility by being able to manage active and reactive energy, being able to contribute to any problem of the electrical system as long as the control system is designed in an adequate manner and the dynamics of operation allow it. The different problems have different solutions; the great benefit is that the proposed system is able to contribute to each of the problems by installing only one device. Delivering more flexibility before scenarios or unforeseen events such as natural disasters and calamitous weather phenomena.

                                    The digital transformation, which is transversal to any sector, in the electric sector we find ourselves specifically in front of other global phenomena that are going to configure the basic elements of the new energy system of the future. Fundamentally, it is about environmental awareness and the growth and urbanization of the population. In these processes, the electrification of society and the generalization of renewable energies, will have beneficial side effects, since they will reduce the energy dependence of our country, by using preferably the available indigenous resources: wind, solar and hydraulic. We can also increase efficiency and energy savings, by replacing any application with its electric version, whenever possible, since the electric version is the one that offers the highest energy efficiency.  In this approaching future energy model, new technologies will appear and new behaviors will develop in consumers. Renewable energies should be complemented by storage systems to give firmness and flexibility to production. There will be new technological structures, such as advanced distributed generation systems, storage systems, mobile batteries, such as electric vehicles, etc. The distribution networks will have to be intelligent, proactive, resilient and have the necessary technological elements to manage these new technological structures that will be connected to the network. There will also be a great development of the smart-grids that, in addition, will have to be able to provide all the information generated by these structures to improve the management of the system itself and make it available to companies and final consumers. Given that the resources needed to produce electricity will be inexhaustible, because they will be renewable energy sources cheap and abundant enough to foster the change. Moreover, in the upcoming electricity market, the electricity cost will be defined by the cost of electric power supply capacity, since the variable cost will be logically zero. On the other hand, it will be key to design the capacity of the system: the production, no doubt, but also storage and of course, network.

                                    The activities in smart cities are focused mainly on effectiveness. Although remarkable, it is not sufficient. We should also consider citizens active participation from suitable informing (regarding all aspects of development) to flexible voting. Having different levels of statistical and IT literacy among stakeholders in mind, and quantitative and qualitative nature of data, the computing with words concept (based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic) is a promising way to cover these topics. Further, many concepts cannot be sharply formalized and many data are fuzzy in their nature. Managing imprecise data, inferring from the data, measuring developments, mining patterns, managing flexible voting and data summarization are tasks, which can be solved by soft computing approaches. The topics and areas include, but not limited to:

                                    In the current global Information Technology scenario, voluminous information from sources like webpages, blogs, social networks, or digital libraries among others, is available for processing. For this reason, new Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems more and more powerful are necessary nowadays; and related to this issue, new fields are emerging like Sentiment Analysis.

                                    Sentiment Analysis/Opinion Mining studies the extraction of opinions or sentiments based on mainly Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence, especially, since the information treated is heterogeneous in nature and lack in precision and completeness. Traditional systems are incompetent to handle these data, therefore, advanced techniques like proposed by Soft Computing (Fuzzy Logic, Neuro-computing, Probabilistic Reasoning, Evolutionary Computation, etc.) are necessary.

                                    In the era of wireless technology, robotics, web service, there are many computing technologies being introduced. With the recent development and progress of IoT (Internet of Things), it is possible to get information about how a system is operating and its real-time status in details. For example, RFID can track the distribution of goods, different sensors can monitor the environment, and GPS can send the location and time back. Based on the information, we could have a log for the monitored system and implement the traceability analysis. Traceability is the ability to verify the history, location, or application of an item. It is especially critical for some industries such as food processing, logistics, supply chain and e-business. The two key technologies for the traceability analysis are data acquisition and management. In the age of cloud computing, they are two promising fields. Although there are several solutions already in place, many challenges remain to be investigated and tackled.

                                    The fields of data mining and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined. Optimization problems lie at the heart of most data mining approaches. For last several years, the researchers have extensively applied quadratic programming into classification, known as V. Vapnik’s Support Vector Machine, as well as various applications. However, using optimization techniques to deal with data separation and data analysis goes back to more than many years ago. According to O. L. Mangasarian, his group has formulated linear programming as a large margin classifier in 1960’s. In 1970’s, A. Charnes and W.W. Cooper initiated Data Envelopment Analysis where a fractional programming is used to evaluate decision making units, which is economic representative data in a given training dataset. From 1980’s to 1990’s, F. Glover proposed a number of linear programming models to solve discriminant problems with a small sample size of data. Then, since 1998, the organizer and his colleagues extended such a research idea into classification via multiple criteria linear programming (MCLP) and multiple criteria quadratic programming (MQLP), which differs from statistics, decision tree induction, and neural networks. So far, there are more than 100 scholars around the world have been actively working on the field of using optimization techniques to handle data mining and web intelligence problems. This workshop intends to promote the research interests in the connection of optimization, data mining and web intelligence as well as real-life applications.

                                    The analysis of inter-risk correlation and risk aggregation is an important factor to risk measurement, such as the interaction of market risk, credit risk and operational risk. Correlation analysis and risk measurement can be viewed as a Multiple Criteria Decision Making problem in a certain extent, which is the trade-off among different aspects, such as the “project triangle”（cost, quality and schedule）.Some mathematical models such as Copula models are used for measuring risk correlation, but risk management must extend far beyond the use of standard measurement in practical operations and applications. An important aspect is to emphasize on the correlation analysis of risks and thus effectively measure all kinds of financial risks.

                                    In order to promote the development of risk correlation and measurement, we organize a special workshop dedicated to the topic of <b>“risk correlation analysis and risk measurement”</b> under the 7th International Conference on Information Technology and Quantitative Management (ITQM 2019)  (http://www.itqm-meeting.org/2019/). The main purpose of this workshop is to provide researchers and practitioners an opportunity to share the most recent advances in the area of risk correlation and measurement, to assess the state of knowledge of risk correlation and measurement, to generate new results in this relatively under-researched area, and determine directions for further research, Papers should present modeling approaches/perspectives to risk correlation and measurement. The workshop is interested in topics related to all aspects of risk correlation and measurement. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

                                    With the development of information technology, more and more data are stored in many fields and different industries. Big data is not only a definition for data but also for the technology and idea to deal with big data. For decision makers, there are still drowned in data but lack of knowledge. Management Science is a subject to solve the problem in management with qualitative and quantitative method. New idea and method in Big data put new energy for management science. Thus, there are new methods and technology in the field big data and management science in recent years.

                                    Data stream is one of the important data types in the financial sector, and it is with the following characteristics, such as arriving quickly, unstable, huge and so on. Traditional analysis methods and theories can’t meet the requirements of financial data stream analysis due to these characteristics. This workshop focuses on how to detect abnormal pattern in data streams especially in financial data streams. In addition, theoretical system and methods of outlier detection would be needed to be proposed. This topic includes outlier detection theory, method and application for financial data stream based on domain knowledge, outlier detection for data stream and empirical analysis.

                                    As E-science has emerged as a persistent and increasingly large part of the research enterprise, scientists are exploring new roles, services, staffing, and resources to address the issues arising from this new mode of research. Scientists use computer modeling and simulation programs to test and produce new theories and experimental techniques, often generating and accumulating vast amounts of data. Ideally, that data could be shared with other scientists, for re-use and re-analysis, ultimately speeding up the process of scientific discovery. The collection and utilization of scientific data are the two primary features that characterize e-Science. The scientific data are generated by different aspects and departments in the management activities of research institutions and are decentralized-managed and separated-stored, which generates the difficult to share and manage the scientific data. Furthermore, the global sharing of data has promoted interdisciplinary teamwork on complex problems and has enabled other researchers to use data for different purposes. Recently, the scientific data analysis for ecological animal husbandry has attracted much attention. Some empirical research, such as the big data management platform for ecological animal husbandry in Qinghai Province China, has generated  significant benefits. The main objective of this workshop is to provide researchers and practitioners an opportunity to share the most recent advances in the area of data science and decision analysis for e-science, especial the ecological animal husbandry. The workshop aims to create a communication platform for researchers to share recent and significant developments in the general area.

                                        With the development of Internet technology and the rapid development of e-commerce, supply chain finance has gradually attracted people's attention. Supply chain finance has an irreplaceable position in the current financial industry.
                                        Supply chain finance means that banks focus on core enterprises, manage the flow of capital and logistics of upstream and downstream SMEs (small and medium enterprises), and transform the uncontrollable risks of individual enterprises into controllable risks of supply chain enterprises as a whole. The lowest financial services.
                                        Supply chain finance is a specialized area of ​​commercial bank credit business (bank level), and it is also a financing channel for enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. It refers to the bank providing financing and other settlement and wealth management services to customers (core enterprises), and providing the customers of these customers with the convenience of timely loan collection, or providing prepaid payment and inventory financing services to their distributors. 
                                        The significance of supply chain finance is to use the supply chain as a commercial chain to form upstream and downstream enterprises to form a capital chain through trade, and then help SMEs to achieve the balance of funds in operation to overcome financing difficulties. The significance of supply chain finance is to revitalize funds, accelerate capital operations, and make business transactions more efficient and convenient.

                                        Business analytics coupled with big data is an emerging phenomenon which creates novel opportunities for organizations and society. Realizing the significance of data in terms of growing volume, variety, velocity and veracity, many organizations such as automobile and healthcare companies increasingly transform into analytics centric enterprises. Analytics are being used in various fields such as social networks, social media, traffic networks, operations and supply chain, consumer choice, and brain science. At an organizational level, the capability to manage big data has a huge impact on their IT management, operation, finance, and strategy. Much research on organizational issues is needed as firms explore how they can use their large volumes of data to create value in their business. This workshop seeks research that promotes technical, theoretical and behavioral research as well as emerging applications in business analytics. Other topics that have relevance to value creation and theoretical/practical implications in the business analytics and supply chain management fields are also welcome.
